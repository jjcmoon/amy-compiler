As mentioned before there are two kinds of TCE being performed. Trampolines, which are more generally useable, and Tail recursion which is more performant, but only useable for recusive tail calls.

For example: the following function whould be optimized with trampolines:
\begin{lstlisting}
object MutualRecursion {
  def odd(n: Int): Boolean = {
    if (n==0) {
      false
    } else {
      even(n-1)
    }
  }

  def even(n: Int): Boolean = {
    if (n==0) {
      true
    } else {
      odd(n-1)
    }
  }

  Std.printBoolean(odd(1000001))
}
\end{lstlisting}

While this program could use tail recursion:\footnote{Note that this example has the most notable diverging behaviour. Without TCE it whould cause a stack overflow almost instantaneously.}

\begin{lstlisting}
object InfiniteLoop {
  def loop():Unit = {
    loop()
  }

  loop()
}
\end{lstlisting}


This leaves the edge case of a program with both kinds of recursion. Here I chose to use trampolines, in order to avoid the complexity of a hybrid approach.
